# Waymont May 2023 Smart Contracts: Integration

The following explains how Waymont's API should use the `WaymontSafePolicyGuardianSigner`, the `WaymontSafeAdvancedSigner`, and the `WaymontSafeTimelockedBackupSignerModule`:

## Enabling and using the `WaymontSafePolicyGuardianSigner`

The `WaymontSafePolicyGuardianSigner` is only deployed once per `WaymontSafeFactory`, meaning that all Waymont `Safe`s will use it (*unless a new version of the `WaymontSafeFactory` and/or `WaymontSafePolicyGuardianSigner` is built and audited down the line*).

### Enabling the policy guardian signer on a `Safe`

1. Add the `WaymontSafePolicyGuardianSigner` as a signer on a `Safe` that would like to use the policy guardian (for now, all `Safe`s).
    - **WARNING: If the user would like an x-of-n `Safe` where x is less than n (i.e., if the user wants to use one of multiple signing devices to sign transactions), the `WaymontSafeAdvancedSigner` and `WaymontSafePolicyGuardianSigner` must be used as the two signers on a 2-of-2 `Safe` (with the actual signers underlying the `WaymontSafeAdvancedSigner`), [as described below](#deploying-enabling-and-using-a-waymontsafeadvancedsigner).**
    - To add the `WaymontSafePolicyGuardianSigner` to a `Safe` as part of the initial `Safe` deployment, simply include the `WaymontSafePolicyGuardianSigner` address in the `_owners` array parameter when deploying and initializing the `Safe` (and use a maxed-out threshold equal to the number of signers on the `Safe` including the policy guardian).
        - [See below for TypeScript code.](#enabling-the-policy-guardian-signer-on-a-new-safe-with-ethersjs)
    - To add the `WaymontSafePolicyGuardianSigner` to a `Safe` down the line, simply call `Safe.addOwnerWithThreshold` (or if using the Protocol Kit, `createAddOwnerTx`) with the `WaymontSafePolicyGuardianSigner` address (and a maxed-out threshold equal to the number of signers on the `Safe` including the policy guardian).
        - **WARNING: Once again, note that if the `Safe` requires less than all signers, the `WaymontSafeAdvancedSigner` and `WaymontSafePolicyGuardianSigner` must be used as the two signers on a 2-of-2 `Safe` (with the actual signers underlying the `WaymontSafeAdvancedSigner`), [as described below](#deploying-enabling-and-using-a-waymontsafeadvancedsigner).**
    - The `WaymontSafePolicyGuardianSigner` address can be found at `WaymontSafeFactory.policyGuardianSigner()`. This should be hardcoded for security (along with the `WaymontSafeFactory` address; there is only one `WaymontSafePolicyGuardianSigner` per `WaymontSafeFactory`).

### Enabling the policy guardian signer on a new `Safe` with `ethers.js`

As a reminder, the `WaymontSafePolicyGuardianSigner` address can be found at `WaymontSafeFactory.policyGuardianSigner()`. This should be hardcoded for security (along with the `WaymontSafeFactory` address; there is only one `WaymontSafePolicyGuardianSigner` per `WaymontSafeFactory`).

The following code is based on [the Safe Protocol Kit's documentation on deploying a Safe](https://docs.safe.global/learn/safe-core/safe-core-account-abstraction-sdk/protocol-kit#deploy-a-safe).

```
import { ethers } from 'ethers';
import {Â EthersAdapter, SafeFactory, SafeAccountConfig } from '@safe-global/protocol-kit';

const WAYMONT_SAFE_POLICY_GUARDIAN_SIGNER_ADDRESS = "0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890";
const RELAYER_SIGNER_PRIVATE_KEY = "0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234";
const USER_DEVICE_SIGNER_ADDRESS = "0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890";

const RPC_URL = "https://eth-goerli.public.blastapi.io"; // https://chainlist.org/?search=goerli&testnets=true
const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(RPC_URL);

// Initialize signer
const relayerSigner = new ethers.Wallet(RELAYER_SIGNER_PRIVATE_KEY, provider);

const ethAdapterRelayer = new EthersAdapter({
  ethers,
  signerOrProvider: relayerSigner
});

// Initialize factory
const safeFactory = await SafeFactory.create({ ethAdapter: ethAdapterRelayer })

// Configure new Safe
const safeAccountConfig: SafeAccountConfig = {
  owners: [
    USER_DEVICE_SIGNER_ADDRESS,
    WAYMONT_SAFE_POLICY_GUARDIAN_SIGNER_ADDRESS
  ],
  threshold: 2
};

// safeSdkUserDevice is tied to the user device signer because the safeFactory was initialized with an adapter using the user device signer
const safeSdkRelayer = await safeFactory.deploySafe({ safeAccountConfig });

// Get Safe address
const safeAddress = await safeSdkRelayer.getAddress();

console.log("Safe deployed at:", `https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/${safeAddress}`, `https://app.safe.global/gor:${safeAddress}`);
```

### Signing transactions with the `WaymontSafePolicyGuardianSigner`

**WARNING: Do not use the policy guardian key for ANYTHING ELSE other than generating signatures for use with the `WaymontSafePolicyGuardianSigner` as described directly below (or to generate policy guardian signatures for the `WaymontSafeTimelockedBackupSignerModule` [as described further below](#recovering-a-safe)). Specifically, do not send any funds to its address. (The reasoning here is simply to isolate the use of the account as much as possible with the goal of reducing collateral attack surface.)**

Normally, when using the Safe TypeScript Protocol Kit to sign the second signature (i.e., the policy guardian's signature) on a proposed transaction [as described here](https://docs.safe.global/learn/safe-core/safe-core-account-abstraction-sdk/protocol-kit#confirm-the-transaction-second-confirmation), the `Safe.signTransactionHash` method is used to instantiate a `new EthSafeSignature` object in order to pass the instantiated object's `data` param as the second argument to `SafeApiKit.confirmTransaction`. In this case, instead of using `Safe.signTransactionHash` to get the signature, one should generate a new wrapped signature to pass as the second argument to `SafeApiKit.confirmTransaction`--this new signature param should be the concatenation of the following three items:

1. A "fake signature" made up of pointers to the "actual underlying signature." In the "fake signature":
    - `r` is the `WaymontSafePolicyGuardianSigner` contract address, `s == 65` (which is the offset of the contract signature length `bytes32` concatenated with the "actual underlying signature"), and `v == 0` (indicating that this is a smart contract signature).
    - *As usual, `r`, `s`, and `v` are concatenated into a bytestring of length 65 where the first 32 bytes are `r`, the next 32 bytes are `s`, and the last byte is `v`.*
2. The length of the "actual underlying signature" as a `bytes32` (always equal to 65).
3. The "actual underlying signature" from the policy guardian key--this can be calculated as: `(new ethers.utils.SigningKey(HEX_ENCODED_UNDERLYING_POLICY_GUARDIAN_PRIVATE_KEY)).signDigest(safeTxHash).serialized` where `safeTxHash` is calculated as `await safeSdk.getTransactionHash(safeTransaction)` (where `safeTransaction` is created by the Safe Protocol Kit's `Safe.createTransaction` method).

#### Signing transactions with the policy guardian with `ethers.js`

The following code is based on [the Safe Protocol Kit's documentation on generating the second signature for a transaction](https://docs.safe.global/learn/safe-core/safe-core-account-abstraction-sdk/protocol-kit#confirm-the-transaction-second-confirmation).

```
import SafeApiKit from '@safe-global/api-kit';

// The underlying policy guardian is the EOA that generates real ECDSA signatures (as opposed to the the overlying policy guardian, which is the `WaymontSafePolicyGuardianSigner` contract)
const HEX_ENCODED_UNDERLYING_POLICY_GUARDIAN_PRIVATE_KEY = "0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234";

const txServiceUrl = 'https://safe-transaction-goerli.safe.global';
const safeService = new SafeApiKit({ txServiceUrl, ethAdapter: ethAdapterRelayer });

// Get pending transactions on the Safe
const pendingTransactions = await safeService.getPendingTransactions(safeAddress).results;

// The following code assumes that the first pending transaction is the transaction the policy guardian wants to confirm
const transaction = pendingTransactions[0];
const safeTxHash = transaction.safeTxHash;

// Generate the actual underlying ECDSA signature
const actualUnderlyingSignature = (new ethers.utils.SigningKey(HEX_ENCODED_UNDERLYING_POLICY_GUARDIAN_PRIVATE_KEY)).signDigest(safeTxHash).serialized;

// Generate the overlying signature
const overlyingSignature = ethers.utils.solidityPack(
    ["bytes32", "bytes32", "uint8", "uint256", "bytes"],
    [
        WAYMONT_SAFE_POLICY_GUARDIAN_SIGNER_ADDRESS,
        65,
        0,
        65,
        actualUnderlyingSignature
    ]
);

// Confirm the transaction using the signature
const response = await safeService.confirmTransaction(safeTxHash, overlyingSignature);
```

Then, of course, execute the transaction, [as seen in the Safe Protocol Kit docs](https://docs.safe.global/learn/safe-core/safe-core-account-abstraction-sdk/protocol-kit#execute-transaction):

```
const safeTransaction = await safeService.getTransaction(safeTxHash);
const executeTxResponse = await safeSdk.executeTransaction(safeTransaction);
const receipt = await executeTxResponse.transactionResponse?.wait();

console.log('Transaction executed at:', `https://goerli.etherscan.io/tx/${receipt.transactionHash}`);
```

#### Preventing transactions from `Safe`s 

**WARNING: Make sure to block transactions sent from `Safe`s to the deployed `WaymontSafePolicyGuardianSigner`, any of the deployed `WaymontSafeAdvancedSigner`s, or any of the deployed `WaymontSafeTimelockedBackupSignerModule`s.** Specifically, in the Waymont API's `createWalletSigningRequest` endpoint, before generating the policy guardian signature or doing anything else, validate that the destination address of the transaction is not any of the addresses of any of the deployed instances of any of these 3 contracts. (For example, if using the [Protocol Kit's example code to create transactions](https://docs.safe.global/learn/safe-core/safe-core-account-abstraction-sdk/protocol-kit#create-a-transaction), simply validate the `destination` variable.)

### Tracking policy guardian removal requests

**WARNING: The following is important to implement for security!**

Waymont should track all `WaymontSafePolicyGuardianSigner.DisablePolicyGuardianQueued` events and immediately notify users if the disabling of the policy guardian on their `Safe` has been queued.

#### Tracking policy guardian removal request events using `ethers.js`

The following code should run regularly in a loop, at least as often as **every 15 minutes**. However, runs should not overlap--if it is time to run the loop again but the last loop is still running, the last loop should be canceled before running the new loop.

```
// TODO: Run the following block of code in a loop every 15 minutes (but don't allow loops to overlap)
const currentBlock = await provider.getBlockNumber();
const filter = waymontSafePolicyGuardianSigner.filters.DisablePolicyGuardianQueued(null);
// TODO: Get `lastCheckedBlock` from database
const eventsSinceLastCheckMinus14Blocks = waymontSafePolicyGuardianSigner.queryFilter(filter, lastCheckedBlock - 13, currentBlock); // Checking since last 14 blocks in case blockchain history was rewritten (i.e., if blocks are orphaned)

for (const event of eventsSinceLastCheckMinus14Blocks) {
    let safeAddress = event.args.safe;
    let eventTransactionHash = event.args.transactionHash;
    let eventLogIndex = event.args.logIndex;
    // TODO: Don't send another notification if notifications have already been sent for this event--note that each event is uniquely identified by its combination of `event.transactionHash` and `event.logIndex` (so if a row in the notification table in the database exists where `transactionHash` and `logIndex` equal this event, then `continue`); alternatively, events can be uniquely identified by their unique combination of `Safe` address (`event.args.safe`), `event.transactionHash`, and event type (in this case, `DisablePolicyGuardianQueued`).
    // TODO: If user has not already been notified, then send a notification saying that disabling the policy guardian was queued by the signing devices on the `Safe` (without the policy guardian's approval) and that the timelock to disable the policy guardian has begun (`Safe` address can be found in `event.args.safe`)
}

// TODO: Overwrite `lastCheckedBlock` in database with `currentBlock`
```

### Tracking policy guardian removal and timelock changes

**The following security feature is not NEARLY as important as tracking the queueing of disabling the policy guardian on `Safe`s [as described above](#tracking-policy-guardian-removal-requests).**

The policy guardian cannot be disabled via the `WaymontSafePolicyGuardianSigner` without either the policy guardian's approval or the user queueing it and waiting for the timelock to pass. The policy guardian timelock also cannot be changed without the without the policy guardian's approval. Nevertheless, given the risk of the policy guardian key being compromised, Waymont should still track `WaymontSafePolicyGuardianSigner.PolicyGuardianDisabledOnSafe` and `WaymontSafePolicyGuardianSigner.PolicyGuardianTimelockChanged` events and emit notifications to users (unless a notification was already emitted because Waymont approved the action).

#### Tracking policy guardian removal and timelock change events using `ethers.js`

See [the instructions above](#tracking-policy-guardian-removal-request-events-using-ethersjs), but instead of tracking the `DisablePolicyGuardianQueued` event, track the `WaymontSafePolicyGuardianSigner.PolicyGuardianDisabledOnSafe` and `WaymontSafePolicyGuardianSigner.PolicyGuardianTimelockChanged` events.

### Extra stuff (not to be implemented now)

*Down the line, to enable users to set a custom policy guardian timelock, use `WaymontSafePolicyGuardianSigner.setPolicyGuardianTimelock` (can batch this using Safe's `MultiSendCallOnly` contract [as described below](#using-safes-multisendcallonly-contract)).*

## Deploying, enabling and using a `WaymontSafeAdvancedSigner`

- A new `WaymontSafeAdvancedSigner` is deployed any time a `Safe` decides it would like to use a `WaymontSafeAdvancedSigner`.
- If the user removes the `WaymontSafeAdvancedSigner` from their `Safe` and decides to add it back, a `WaymontSafeAdvancedSigner` should be deployed to avoid having to clean up the signers on the old `WaymontSafeAdvancedSigner`.

### Deploying and enabling the `WaymontAdvancedSigner` on a `Safe`

If the user would like an x-of-n `Safe` where x is less than n (i.e., if the user wants to use one of multiple signing devices to sign transactions), the user's signing devices should not be added as signers on the actual `Safe` itself, but should be added as underlying signers on a new `WaymontSafeAdvancedSigner` contract. Then, add the `WaymontSafeAdvancedSigner` and `WaymontSafePolicyGuardianSigner` as the only two signers on the `Safe` (will be a 2-of-2 `Safe` at the `Safe` level) .
    - Deployment of the signer and the addition of the signer to the `Safe` should be done in reverse order (using the `MultiSendCallOnly` contract [as described below](#using-safes-multisendcallonly-contract)):
        1. To add the signer to the `Safe`, simply call `Safe.addOwnerWithThreshold(address(waymontSafeAdvancedSigner), 1)`.
            - The address of the module can be computed as the last 20 bytes of `keccak256(abi.encodePacked(0xff, waymontSafeFactoryAddress, salt, minimalProxyCreationCodeHash))` where `salt` is `keccak256(abi.encode(safe, signers, threshold, deploymentNonce))` and `minimalProxyCreationCodeHash` is `keccak256(abi.encodePacked(hex'3d602d80600a3d3981f3363d3d373d3d3d363d73', advancedSignerImplementation, hex'5af43d82803e903d91602b57fd5bf3'))`.
                - The `advancedSignerImplementation` is immutable for a given `WaymontSafeFactory` and can be found by calling `WaymontSafeFactory.advancedSignerImplementation()`.This should be hardcoded for security (along with the `WaymontSafeFactory` address; there is only one `WaymontSafeAdvancedSigner` implementation per `WaymontSafeFactory`).

        2. To deploy the signer, call `WaymontSafeFactory.createAdvancedSigner(Safe safe, address[] signers, uint256 threshold, uint256 deploymentNonce)`.
            - `signers` will be the underlying mobile signer keys, as has been done in the past, but without the social recovery guardian keys.

#### Calculating the CREATE2 address of the `WaymontAdvancedSigner`

As a reminder, the `WaymontSafeAdvancedSigner` implementation contract address is immutable for a given `WaymontSafeFactory` and can be found by calling `WaymontSafeFactory.advancedSignerImplementation()`.This should be hardcoded for security (along with the `WaymontSafeFactory` address; there is only one `WaymontSafeAdvancedSigner` implementation per `WaymontSafeFactory`).

The `WaymontAdvancedSigner`'s init bytecode/"creation code" (this is NOT the deployed runtime bytecode) can be found in the compilation artifacts for the contract.

```
const WAYMONT_SAFE_ADVANCED_SIGNER_IMPLEMENTATION_ADDRESS = "0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890";
const WAYMONT_SAFE_ADVANCED_SIGNER_INIT_CREATION_CODE = "0x...";

function predictWaymontSafeAdvancedSignerAddress(predictedSafeAddress, signers, threshold, deploymentNonce) {
    const salt = ethers.utils.keccak256(ethers.utils.defaultAbiCoder.encode(
        ["address", "address[]", "uint256", "uint256"],
        [predictedSafeAddress, signers, threshold, deploymentNonce]
    ));
    const initCodeHash = ethers.utils.keccak256(ethers.utils.solidityPack(
        ["bytes", "address", "bytes"],
        [
            "0x3d602d80600a3d3981f3363d3d373d3d3d363d73",
            WAYMONT_SAFE_ADVANCED_SIGNER_IMPLEMENTATION_ADDRESS,
            "5af43d82803e903d91602b57fd5bf3"
        ]
    ));
    const waymontSafeAdvancedSignerAddress = ethers.utils.keccak256(ethers.utils.solidityPack(
        ["bytes1", "address", "bytes32", "bytes32"],
        ["0xff", WAYMONT_SAFE_FACTORY_ADDRESS, salt, initCodeHash]
    ));
    return waymontSafeAdvancedSignerAddress;
}
```

#### Deploying a new `Safe` with a new `WaymontAdvancedSigner` using `ethers.js`

Normally, to deploy a safe via the Protocol Kit, one would call [`SafeFactory.deploySafe`](https://docs.safe.global/learn/safe-core/safe-core-account-abstraction-sdk/protocol-kit#deploy-a-safe). In this case, one should call the following custom function, `deploySafeWithWaymontSafeAdvancedSigner`:

```
const { randomBytes } = require('crypto');

    SafeFactory,

### Signing transactions with the `WaymontSafeAdvancedSigner`

Normally, when using the Safe TypeScript Protocol Kit to sign the first signature (i.e., the user's signing device's signature) on a proposed transaction [as described here](https://docs.safe.global/learn/safe-core/safe-core-account-abstraction-sdk/protocol-kit#confirm-the-transaction-second-confirmation), the `Safe.signTransactionHash` method is used to instantiate a `new EthSafeSignature` object in order to pass the instantiated object's `data` param as the second argument to `SafeApiKit.confirmTransaction`. In this case, instead of passing in the `EthSafeSignature.data` param directly into `SafeApiKit.confirmTransaction`, it should be wrapped into a new signature param--this new signature param should be the concatenation of:

1. A "fake signature" made up of pointers to the "actual underlying signature." In the "fake signature":
    - `r` is the `WaymontSafeAdvancedSigner` contract address, `s == 65` (which is the offset of the contract signature length `bytes32` concatenated with the "actual underlying signature"), and `v == 0` (indicating that this is a smart contract signature).
    - *As usual, `r`, `s`, and `v` are concatenated into a bytestring of length 65 where the first 32 bytes are `r`, the next 32 bytes are `s`, and the last byte is `v`.*
2. The length of the "actual underlying signature" as a `bytes32`.
3. The "actual underlying signature" from the user's signing device generated with `Safe.signTransactionHash`.

## Deploying, enabling, and using a `WaymontSafeTimelockedBackupSignerModule`

- A new `WaymontSafeTimelockedBackupSignerModule` is deployed any time a `Safe` decides it would like to use a `WaymontSafeTimelockedBackupSignerModule`.
- If the user removes the `WaymontSafeTimelockedBackupSignerModule` from their `Safe` and decides to add it back, a `WaymontSafeTimelockedBackupSignerModule` should be deployed to avoid having to clean up the signers on the old module.

### Deploying and enabling

Add the `WaymontSafeTimelockedBackupSignerModule` to the `Safe` to enable timelocked social recovery guardians.

- Timelocked social recovery guardians will not be signers on the `Safe`: instead, they will be a module called `WaymontTimelockedBackupSignerSafeModule`, which allows setting up recovery signers with timelocked signing and validating their signatures after the timelock (queued before the timelock with `queueSignature`) and the policy guardian signature (instead of the actual signers on the `Safe` itself).
- Deployment of the module and the enabling of the module should be done in reverse order (using the `MultiSendCallOnly` contract [as described below](#using-safes-multisendcallonly-contract)):
    1. To enable the module, simply call `Safe.enableModule(address(waymontTimelockedBackupSignerSafeModule))`.
        - The address of the module can be computed as the last 20 bytes of `keccak256(abi.encodePacked(0xff, waymontSafeFactoryAddress, salt, minimalProxyCreationCodeHash))` where `salt` is `keccak256(abi.encode(safe, signers, threshold, signingTimelock, requirePolicyGuardian, deploymentNonce))` and `minimalProxyCreationCodeHash` is `keccak256(0x3d602d80600a3d3981f3363d3d373d3d3d363d73${timelockedBackupSignerModuleImplementation}5af43d82803e903d91602b57fd5bf3)`.
            - The `timelockedBackupSignerModuleImplementation` is immutable for a given `WaymontSafeFactory` and can be found by calling `WaymontSafeFactory.timelockedBackupSignerModuleImplementation()`.
    2. To deploy the module, call `WaymontSafeFactory.createTimelockedBackupSignerModule(Safe safe, address[] signers, uint256 threshold, uint256 signingTimelock, bool requirePolicyGuardian, uint256 deploymentNonce)`.
        - `signers` will be an array of social recovery guardian signing keys and `threshold` should equal the ceiling of 51% of the number of signers.
        - `signingTimelock` should be the quantity of time in seconds that must pass after queuing a signature in order to use it to execute a recovery transaction.
        - `requirePolicyGuardian` indicated whether or not the policy guardian should be required for recovery: for now, this will be enabled on all wallets.
        - Ideally, `deploymentNonce` is incremental for each `Safe`, but it can also be based on a global counter (not localized to any `Safe`) or a random number.

### Recovering a `Safe`

**WARNING: Do not use the policy guardian key for ANYTHING ELSE other than generating signatures for use with the `WaymontSafePolicyGuardianSigner` [as described above](#signing-transactions-with-the-waymontsafepolicyguardiansigner) or to generate policy guardian signatures for the `WaymontSafeTimelockedBackupSignerModule` as described directly below. Specifically, do not send any funds to its address. (The reasoning here is simply to isolate the use of the account as much as possible with the goal of reducing collateral attack surface.)**

#### Beginning the recovery request timelock

To begin the timelock, each of the necessary threshold of recovery signers must call `WaymontSafeTimelockedBackupSignerModule.queueSignature(bytes32 underlyingHash, bytes signature, bytes policyGuardianSignature)`.

- Param `underlyingHash` is computed as `keccak256(abi.encode(EXEC_TRANSACTION_TYPEHASH, safe, waymontSafeTimelockedBackupSignerModule.nonce(), to, value, keccak256(data), operation))` where `EXEC_TRANSACTION_TYPEHASH == 0x60c023ac5b12ccfb6346228598efbab110f9f06cd102f7009adbf0dbb8b8c240` and `value == 0`.
    - Fill in `to`, `data`, and `operation` with the values returned from the Protocol Kit's `Safe.createSwapOwnerTx` method (to replace the lost signer on the wallet with a working one) or the `Safe.createAddOwnerTx` method (to just add a new working signer on the wallet).
- Param `signature` is the recovery guardian's 65-byte packed signature on `keccak256(txHashData)` (or `keccak256(abi.encodePacked("\x19Ethereum Signed Message:\n32", keccak256(txHashData)))` with `4` added to the `signature` param's `v` param if `signTypedData` is not available on the recovery signer, [as is the case with WalletConnect](https://docs.walletconnect.com/2.0/advanced/rpc-reference/ethereum-rpc#eth_signtypeddata)) where `txHashData` is `abi.encodePacked(bytes1(0x19), bytes1(0x01), domainSeparator(), underlyingHash)`.
    - `domainSeparator()` is defined as `keccak256(abi.encode(DOMAIN_SEPARATOR_TYPEHASH, getChainId(), waymontSafeTimelockedBackupSignerModule))` where `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR_TYPEHASH == 0x47e79534a245952e8b16893a336b85a3d9ea9fa8c573f3d803afb92a79469218` and `getChainId()` is a 32-byte `uint256`.
    - To calculate this signature, follow [the instructions below to use `ethers.Signer._signTypedData` (with ethers.js) to generate the recovery guardian signature](#generating-the-recovery-guardian-signature-using-ethersjs-for-use-with-both-queuesignature-and-exectransaction).
- Param `policyGuardianSignature` is the policy guardian's 65-byte packed signature on `keccak256(abi.encodePacked(bytes1(0x19), bytes1(0x01), domainSeparator(), queueSignatureUnderlyingHash)` where `queueSignatureUnderlyingHash` is `keccak256(abi.encode(QUEUE_SIGNATURE_TYPEHASH, keccak256(signature)))` (where `signature` is the `signature` param, the recovery guardian's 65-byte packed signature).
    - To calculate this signature, follow [the instructions below to use `ethers.Signer._signTypedData` (with ethers.js) to generate the policy guardian signature](#generating-the-policy-guardian-signature-for-use-with-queuesignature-using-ethersjs).

##### Generating the recovery guardian signature using ethers.js (for use with both `queueSignature` and `execTransaction`)

To use `ethers.Signer._signTypedData` (with ethers.js) to generate the policy guardian signature (for use with both `WaymontSafeTimelockedBackupSignerModule.queueSignature` and `WaymontSafeTimelockedBackupSignerModule.execTransaction`):

```
const domain = {
    chainId: 1,
    verifyingContract: timelockedBackupSignerModule.address
};

const types = {
    ExecTransaction: [
        { name: 'safe', type: 'address' }
        { name: 'nonce', type: 'uint256' }
        { name: 'to', type: 'address' }
        { name: 'value', type: 'uint256' }
        { name: 'data', type: 'bytes' }
        { name: 'operation', type: 'uint8' }
    ]
};

const swapOwnerTx = await safeSdk.createSwapOwnerTx({ oldOwnerAddress, newOwnerAddress });

const value = {
    safe: safe.address,
    nonce: await waymontSafeTimelockedBackupSignerModule.nonce(),
    to: swapOwnerTx.data.to,
    value: '0',
    data: swapOwnerTx.data.data,
    operation: swapOwnerTx.data.operation,
};

const signature = await recoveryGuardianEthersWallet.signTypedData(domain, types, value);
```

As mentioned above, fill in `to`, `data`, and `operation` with the values returned from the Protocol Kit's `Safe.createSwapOwnerTx` method or the `Safe.createAddOwnerTx` method.

##### Generating the policy guardian signature for use with `queueSignature` using ethers.js

To use `ethers.Signer._signTypedData` (with ethers.js) to generate the policy guardian signature for use with `WaymontSafeTimelockedBackupSignerModule.queueSignature`:

```
const domain = {
    chainId: 1,
    verifyingContract: timelockedBackupSignerModule.address
};

const types = {
    QueueSignature: [
        { name: 'signature', type: 'bytes' }
    ]
};

const value = {
    signature: recoveryGuardianSignatureHex
};

const policyGuardianSignatureHex = await policyGuardianEthersWallet.signTypedData(domain, types, value);
```

#### Executing the recovery request

After the signing timelock has passed, to execute the recovery request, call `WaymontSafeTimelockedBackupSignerModule.execTransaction(address to, uint256 value, bytes data, Enum.Operation operation, bytes signatures)`.

- Fill in `to`, `data`, and `operation` with the values returned from the Protocol Kit's `Safe.createSwapOwnerTx` method or the `Safe.createAddOwnerTx` method.
- `value == 0` again obviously.
- `signatures` should be the packed concatenation of the 65-byte recovery guardian signatures queued earlier, in ascending order of signer address, concatenated with the 65-byte policy guardian signature at the end.
    - Follow [the instructions below to generate the policy guardian signature for use with `execTransaction` below](#generating-the-policy-guardian-signature-for-use-with-waymontsafetimelockedbackupsignermoduleexectransaction-using-ethersjs).

##### Generating the policy guardian signature for use with `WaymontSafeTimelockedBackupSignerModule.execTransaction` using ethers.js

To use `ethers.Signer._signTypedData` (with ethers.js) to generate the policy guardian signature for use with `WaymontSafeTimelockedBackupSignerModule.execTransaction`:

```
const domain = {
    chainId: 1,
    verifyingContract: timelockedBackupSignerModule.address
};

const types = {
    ExecTransaction: [
        { name: 'safe', type: 'address' }
        { name: 'nonce', type: 'uint256' }
        { name: 'to', type: 'address' }
        { name: 'value', type: 'uint256' }
        { name: 'data', type: 'bytes' }
        { name: 'operation', type: 'uint8' }
    ]
};

const swapOwnerTx = await safeSdk.createSwapOwnerTx({ oldOwnerAddress, newOwnerAddress });

const value = {
    safe: safe.address,
    nonce: await waymontSafeTimelockedBackupSignerModule.nonce(),
    to: swapOwnerTx.data.to,
    value: '0',
    data: swapOwnerTx.data.data,
    operation: swapOwnerTx.data.operation,
};

const signature = await policyGuardianEthersWallet.signTypedData(domain, types, value);
```

Note that this code is identical to [the code above](#generating-the-recovery-guardian-signature-using-ethersjs), but the `policyGuardianEthersWallet` is used to sign instead of the `recoveryGuardianEthersWallet`. *As above, fill in `to`, `data`, and `operation` with the values returned from the Protocol Kit's `Safe.createSwapOwnerTx` method or the `Safe.createAddOwnerTx` method.*

### Tracking queueing of social recovery signatures

**The following security feature is not NEARLY as important as tracking the queueing of disabling the policy guardian on `Safe`s [as described above](#tracking-policy-guardian-removal-requests).**

For `WaymontSafeTimelockedBackupSignerModule` instances that have been deployed without a policy guardian attached cannot queue signatures from recovery signers without the policy guardian's approval. Nevertheless, given the risk of the policy guardian key being compromised, Waymont should still track `WaymontSafeTimelockedBackupSignerModule.SignatureQueued` events and emit notifications to users (unless a notification was already emitted because Waymont did approve the queueing of the recovery guardian signature). And of course, if the policy guardian were ever to be disabled, then this notification system becomes extremely important.

#### Tracking social recovery signature queueing events using `ethers.js`

See [the instructions above](#tracking-policy-guardian-removal-request-events-using-ethersjs), but instead of tracking the `DisablePolicyGuardianQueued` event, track the `WaymontSafeTimelockedBackupSignerModule.SignatureQueued` event. Also, check for duplicates using the unique combination of `event.args.safe`, `event.args.signer`, and `event.args.signedDataHash` (as opposed to using the `event.transactionHash` and `event.logIndex` to check for duplicates).

## Using Safe's `MultiSendCallOnly` contract

Call `MultiSendCallOnly(0x40A2aCCbd92BCA938b02010E17A5b8929b49130D).multiSend(transactions)` where `transactions` is the concatenation (for each transaction) of `abi.encodePacked(uint8(0), to, value, data.length, data)` where `to` is a 20-byte `address`, `value` is a 32-byte `uint256` (which will always be set to `0`), and `data.length` is a 32-byte `uint256`.

The source code can be found here (note that we are using the `v1.3.0` version since the `v1.4.0` version has not yet been deployed):

- https://github.com/safe-global/safe-contracts/blob/v1.3.0/contracts/libraries/MultiSendCallOnly.sol
- https://etherscan.io/address/0x40A2aCCbd92BCA938b02010E17A5b8929b49130D#code

### Using `MultiSendCallOnly` in `ethers.js`

```
const MULTI_SEND_CALL_ONLY_ADDRESS = "0x40A2aCCbd92BCA938b02010E17A5b8929b49130D";
const MULTI_SEND_CALL_ONLY_ABI = [{"inputs":[{"internalType":"bytes","name":"transactions","type":"bytes"}],"name":"multiSend","outputs":[],"stateMutability":"payable","type":"function"}];

async function multiSend(transactions, signerOrProvider, options) {
    const multiSendCallOnly = new ethers.Contract(MULTI_SEND_CALL_ONLY_ADDRESS, MULTI_SEND_CALL_ONLY_ABI, signerOrProvider);

    let packedTransactions = "0x";
    for (const tx of transactions) packedTransactions += ethers.utils.solidityPack(["uint8", "address", "uint256", "uint256", "bytes"], [0, tx.to, 0, tx.data.length, tx.data]).substring(2);

    return await multiSendCallOnly.multiSend(packedTransactions, options);
}
```
